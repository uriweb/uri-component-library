            <p>This is the University of Rhode Islandâ€™s style guide for all things digital.  It allows us to stay on-brand and deliver consistently clear and useful content to our digital audience.  We accomplish this through precise writing and digital design that, together, project a relatable yet authoritative presence, guiding the user to the information they need while encouraging them to think big along the way.</p>
            <p>The style guide has several sections, and depending on your needs you may not need to refer to all of them.  The Layout, Style, and Components sections relate to digital design, while the Writing section will include remarks on grammar, style, and formatting for language across the digital spectrum.</p>
            <p>Also, keep in mind that this is a living document.  Pages and code may change at any time as features are developed and revised.</p>

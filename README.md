The Component Library standardizes the look and feel of web elements, and makes it fast and simple to build webpages that look great and stay on-brand.

See [this documentation](https://www.uri.edu/wordpress/components/) to learn about components and how to use them.

## What's new in 5.0.3.x

> IMPORTANT: CL 5.0.3.x are supplemental updates to v5.0.2 released after v5.1.0.  This release was created off of v5.0.2 and will *not* be merged into `master`. It contains changes not released in v5.1.0, but that will be included in later versions.  If upgrading from v5.0.2, the recommendation is to either adopt v5.0.3.x or wait until a successor to v5.1.0 is released.

### v5.0.3.3

* Adds jQuery as a dependency.

# URI Component Library

The Component Library exists in order to standardize the look and feel of web elements, and make it fast and simple to build webpages that look great and stay on-brand.

## What's new in 2.1.1

CL 2.1.1 is a bug fix release:

* Fixes an issue that caused compact tiles to have bottom padding equal to the tile width
* Removes extra padding on tiles paragraphs, panels, and notices
* Other minor fixes

## New in 2.1.0

* Adopts consistant grid layout:
    * Block-level elements have a bottom margin
    * Inline elements and tiles have no margin
* Cards and metrics are now full width components, unless floated
* Buttons are now inline elements
* Upgrades license to GPLv3

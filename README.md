# URI Component Library

The Component Library exists in order to standardize the look and feel of web elements, and make it fast and simple to build webpages that look great and stay on-brand.

## What's new in 3.7.0

CL 3.7.0 is a minor release focused on Slideshow enhancements and video support.

### Slideshows:
* Rebuilt from the ground up to be more fluid and responsive, especially on touch devices
* Introduces a redesigned, more compact interface
* Figures and captions are now accessibility compliant
* Fixes an issue where some images may have been cropped depending on the size of the slideshow

### Vimeo Support:
* Video and Hero components now support content from Vimeo using either the full or embed URL
* Full YouTube URLs may now be used to specify vidoes
* Backward-compatible with existing shortcodes using the 11-character video id
* All support is built onto the `vid` shortcode attribute; no additional attributes or modifications to existing shortcodes are required

### Additional Updates:
* Adds a Share component for sharing the current page or post on social media; currently supports Twitter and Facebook
* Fixes a contrast issue with link text in Boxouts and Panels
* Updates development tools

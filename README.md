# URI Component Library

The Component Library exists in order to standardize the look and feel of web elements, and make it fast and simple to build webpages that look great and stay on-brand.

## What's new in 4.2.0

CL 4.2.0 is a minor release focused on Block Editor support.

### Enhancements in the Block Editor
* Adds support for creating Notices, Dates, Promos, and Menus
* Background images of Heroes can now be positioned using the Focal Point Picker
* More components can now preview custom CSS classes in the editor
* Removes the alignment block control on components for which it is not applicable

### General Improvements
* Adds a new `micro` format for Promos
* The content wrapper HTML tag can now be specified in Notice components
* Updates admin icons with a cleaner, more consistent look
* Fixes an issue that caused the interface to freeze when fully deleting a component's paragraph content in the Block Editor
* Updates development tools
* Other bug fixes

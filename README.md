This is the University of Rhode Islandâ€™s style guide for all things digital.  View it at [http://uriweb.bitbucket.io/](http://uriweb.bitbucket.io/)

The style guide website is served from this repository, where the component library is also built, tested and documented.  Because the whole thing lives in a repository, it should come as no surprise that it is a living document.

# URI Component Library

The Component Library exists in order to standardize the look and feel of web elements, and make it fast and simple to build webpages that look great and stay on-brand.

## What's new in 3.2.0

* Tabs can now be specifically linked to and opened automatically
* Quote citations are now optional
* Metric background colors can now be customized
* Adds a universial class for adding bottom margin to inline elements
* Updates code styles to meet the latest WordPress standards

# URI Component Library

The Component Library exists in order to standardize the look and feel of web elements, and make it fast and simple to build webpages that look great and stay on-brand.

## What's new in 2.2.0

* Includes big improvements for superheros
* Adds better handling of long metrics
* Fixes an issue in menus that caused the default menu to be the first WordPress menu created, not necessarily the primary menu
* Other minor fixes

            <p>This document provides guidelines for creating links on University of Rhode Island websites.  Many of the guidelines are presented as rules, but it’s important to remember that every rule has an exception. </p>

                <h2>How to link</h2>
                <p>Knowing how to create a proper link is important to the University and it directly supports the president’s Transformational Goals for the 21st Century:</p>
                <blockquote>"Build a Community at the University of Rhode Island that Values and Embraces Equity and Diversity."</blockquote>
                <p>Links on URI’s websites must be accessible to all users regardless of the technology used to browse the site. Some visitors are using touchscreen devices with small screens; some are using desktop workstations with a keyboard and mouse; and others are using screen reader software to listen to web pages.</p>
                <p>Links must be formatted in a way that makes them not only user-friendly but also usable for everyone.</p>
                <article>
                    <h3>Let links breathe</h3>
                    <p>Space links apart. Limit links to three per paragraph or two per sentence. Too many links become distracting and make pages harder to read.</p>
                    <p>Do not link every instance of a term. Linking to something once per page — usually from the first instance — is sufficient.</p>
                    <p>Be judicious. Not everything that can be linked needs to be linked. Create links only when the links provide context and only when following the link reveals additional, relevant information.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Make links atomic</h3>
                    <p>Each link should be self-contained and comprehensible when removed from its context. In other words, if the only thing on the webpage were the link, it should be obvious what the link points to. People skim pages, and clearly labeled links stand out.</p>
                    <p><b>Use descriptive link text that describes what the link points to.</b> Never use <i>“click here”</i> because it isn’t informative, and <i>click</i> is an outdated term.</p>

                <p>At the University of Rhode Island, it’s considered a best practice to link the following resources on first mention.</p>

                    <h3>Colleges</h3>

                    <h3>Faculty</h3>
                    <p>Link to faculty when their names are mentioned. All faculty should have a “meet” (bio) page on the URI website, typically in their affiliated college or department. For example:</p>
                    <xmp class="prettyprint">

                    <p>Many faculty have research projects or lab sites that provide additional information and context to pages.  Link to relevant faculty research when it provides an opportunity for an interested visitor to learn more about the topic at hand.</p>

                    <p>There are times when URI has a partnership with an external organization, and it’s appropriate to link to the partner’s website. Be sure external links are relevant to the context of the page, and <b>never</b> use links for advertising purposes.</p>
                    <p>Avoid linking to URI resources that are unbranded or improperly branded.</p>

            <section id="language">
                <h2>Link language</h2>
                <p><b>Links should describe the page to which they refer.</b></p>
                <p>Think about your goals for your visitors. What would you have them do, what action would you have them take after reading your copy? Links should be created with this goal of driving the reader toward a desired action.</p>
                <p>A couple of things to consider:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <b>Be strategic in your link placement.</b>
                        <p>Writing your copy so that the first link that appears on the page is the one you most want your users to click greatly improves the chances of that happening. It’s a well-documented fact that people don’t read web pages in their entirety. In fact, one web writing expert (<a href="http://www.copyblogger.com">copyblogger.com</a>) says that 80 percent of your visitors will read the first header on your page and only 20 percent will continue on. So, it’s important to keep that most-desired call to action high on the page.</p>
                        <p>Placing your link at the end of the sentence in which it appears increases the likelihood that users will read what precedes it. Links placed at the beginning of sentences make that much less likely to happen.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Use descriptive, unique language and front-load hyperlinks with keywords.</b>
                        <p>Users scan rather than read on the web. They are specifically looking for words that match whatever question or task they have in mind that has brought them to your site. Using language in your hyperlinks that mimics what they are thinking makes it more likely that they’ll click the link.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Incorporate into your hyperlink the title or header of the page you would send them to.</b>
                        <p>In doing so, you preview the content to come and eliminate any confusion for users about where they’ll end up when they click.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            
            <section id="maintain">
                <h2>Maintain your links</h2>
                <p>URLs and content change. Periodically review links to ensure they still point to the intended resource. This is especially important when linking externally, since non-URI sites can change without warning, and it’s important for the University’s reputation that all links point to relevant resources.</p>
